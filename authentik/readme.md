Use my compose, and required fields as well as make a password for the DB, 
use this command:
```
echo "PG_PASS=$(openssl rand -base64 36 | tr -d '\n')" >> .env
echo "AUTHENTIK_SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 60 | tr -d '\n')" >> .env
```
To generate the secret key.

In your Traefik compose make these changes:

```
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      - ./certs:/letsencrypt
     #new - ./conf:/etc/traefik/conf/
```
Defined conf file for authentik
```
- "traefik.http.routers.traefik-dashboard.middlewares=authentik@file"
```
A new redirect will be made to redirect anyone requesting a service to Traefik login!

In your traefik compose directory it should look like this: <br/>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f51d19f-0657-47d2-85b6-1ff19299b68c)

And under conf there should be headers.yaml for the coded redirecting to Authentik
